Hi, ðŸ‘‹

if this is about a bug, before you go ahead, please do us a favour and make sure to check the [threejs issue tracker](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues) for the problem you are experiencing. This library is just a soft wrap around threejs without direct dependencies. So if something is flipped upside down, or doesn't project the way you intent to, there's a good chance others will have experienced the same issue with plain threejs.
